      <description>Overview simtrial provides comprehensive simulation capabilities for clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints. It enables researchers to validate trial designs, assess operating characteristics, and optimize study parameters through Monte Carlo simulation.&#xA;Installation # Install from CRAN install.packages(&amp;#34;simtrial&amp;#34;) # Install development version from GitHub devtools::install_github(&amp;#34;Merck/simtrial&amp;#34;) Key Features Flexible Simulation Framework: Simulate various trial designs and scenarios Time-to-Event Focus: Specialized for survival and time-to-event endpoints Operating Characteristics: Comprehensive evaluation of design performance Scenario Analysis: Test multiple assumptions and design variations Integration: Works seamlessly with gsDesign and gsDesign2 Basic Usage Simple Simulation library(simtrial) # Define trial parameters enroll_rate &amp;lt;- define_enroll_rate(duration = 18, rate = 20) fail_rate &amp;lt;- define_fail_rate( duration = c(4, 100), fail_rate = log(2) / 12, hr = c(1, 0.</description>
