TITLE: Blinded estimation of average hazard ratio 
DESCRIPTION: 
Based on blinded data and assumed hazard ratios in different intervals,
compute a blinded estimate of average hazard ratio (AHR) and corresponding
estimate of statistical information.
This function is intended for use in computing futility bounds based on
spending assuming the input hazard ratio (hr) values for intervals
specified here.
 
ARGUMENTS: surv Input survival object (see \code{\link[survival:Surv]{survival::Surv()}});
note that only 0 = censored, 1 = event for \code{\link[survival:Surv]{survival::Surv()}}.
intervals Vector containing positive values indicating
interval lengths where the exponential rates are assumed.
Note that a final infinite interval is added if any events occur
after the final interval specified.
hr Vector of hazard ratios assumed for each interval.
ratio Ratio of experimental to control randomization. 
EXAMPLE: 
ahr_blinded(
  surv = survival::Surv(
    time = simtrial::ex2_delayed_effect$month,
    event = simtrial::ex2_delayed_effect$evntd
  ),
  intervals = c(4, 100),
  hr = c(1, .55),
  ratio = 1
)
 


FUNCTION: ahr 
TITLE: Average hazard ratio under non-proportional hazards 
DESCRIPTION: 
Provides a geometric average hazard ratio under
various non-proportional hazards assumptions for either single or multiple strata studies.
The piecewise exponential distribution allows a simple method to specify a distribution
and enrollment pattern where the enrollment, failure and dropout rates changes over time.
 
ARGUMENTS: enroll_rate An \code{enroll_rate} data frame with or without stratum
created by \code{\link[=define_enroll_rate]{define_enroll_rate()}}.
fail_rate A \code{fail_rate} data frame with or without stratum
created by \code{\link[=define_fail_rate]{define_fail_rate()}}.
total_duration Total follow-up from start of enrollment to data
cutoff; this can be a single value or a vector of positive numbers.
ratio Ratio of experimental to control randomization. 
EXAMPLE: 
# Example 1: default
ahr()

# Example 2: default with multiple analysis times (varying total_duration)
ahr(total_duration = c(15, 30))

# Example 3: stratified population
enroll_rate &lt;- define_enroll_rate(
  stratum = c(rep(&#34;Low&#34;, 2), rep(&#34;High&#34;, 3)),
  duration = c(2, 10, 4, 4, 8),
  rate = c(5, 10, 0, 3, 6)
)
fail_rate &lt;- define_fail_rate(
  stratum = c(rep(&#34;Low&#34;, 2), rep(&#34;High&#34;, 2)),
  duration = c(1, Inf, 1, Inf),
  fail_rate = c(.1, .2, .3, .4),
  dropout_rate = .001,
  hr = c(.9, .75, .8, .6)
)
ahr(enroll_rate = enroll_rate, fail_rate = fail_rate, total_duration = c(15, 30))

FUNCTION: expected_event 
TITLE: Expected events observed under piecewise exponential model 
DESCRIPTION: 
Computes expected events over time and by strata
under the assumption of piecewise constant enrollment rates and piecewise
exponential failure and censoring rates.
The piecewise exponential distribution allows a simple method to specify a distribution
and enrollment pattern
where the enrollment, failure and dropout rates changes over time.
While the main purpose may be to generate a trial that can be analyzed at a single point in time or
using group sequential methods, the routine can also be used to simulate an adaptive trial design.
The intent is to enable sample size calculations under non-proportional hazards assumptions
for stratified populations.
 
ARGUMENTS: enroll_rate An \code{enroll_rate} data frame with or without stratum
created by \code{\link[=define_enroll_rate]{define_enroll_rate()}}.
fail_rate A \code{fail_rate} data frame with or without stratum
created by \code{\link[=define_fail_rate]{define_fail_rate()}}.
total_duration Total follow-up from start of enrollment to data cutoff.
simple If default (\code{TRUE}), return numeric expected number of events,
otherwise a data frame as described below. 
EXAMPLE: 
library(gsDesign2)

# Default arguments, simple output (total event count only)
expected_event()

# Event count by time period
expected_event(simple = FALSE)

# Early cutoff
expected_event(total_duration = .5)

# Single time period example
expected_event(
  enroll_rate = define_enroll_rate(duration = 10, rate = 10),
  fail_rate = define_fail_rate(duration = 100, fail_rate = log(2) / 6, dropout_rate = .01),
  total_duration = 22,
  simple = FALSE
)

# Single time period example, multiple enrollment periods
expected_event(
  enroll_rate = define_enroll_rate(duration = c(5, 5), rate = c(10, 20)),
  fail_rate = define_fail_rate(duration = 100, fail_rate = log(2) / 6, dropout_rate = .01),
  total_duration = 22, simple = FALSE
)
 


FUNCTION: expected_time 
TITLE: Predict time at which a targeted event count is achieved 
DESCRIPTION: 
\code{expected_time()} is made to match input format with \code{\link[=ahr]{ahr()}} and to solve for the
time at which the expected accumulated events is equal to an input target.
Enrollment and failure rate distributions are specified as follows.
The piecewise exponential distribution allows a simple method to specify a distribution
and enrollment pattern
where the enrollment, failure and dropout rates changes over time.
 
ARGUMENTS: enroll_rate An \code{enroll_rate} data frame with or without stratum
created by \code{\link[=define_enroll_rate]{define_enroll_rate()}}.

and \code{lower} arguments in \code{\link[=gs_power_npe]{gs_power_npe()}} and \code{\link[=gs_design_npe]{gs_design_npe()}} or the
\code{upper_bound} and \code{lower_bound} arguments in \code{gs_prob_combo()} and
\code{pmvnorm_combo()}.
It simply returns the vector of Z-values in the input vector \code{par} or,
if \code{k} is specified, \code{par[k]} is returned.
Note that if bounds need to change with changing information at analyses,
\code{gs_b()} should not be used.
For instance, for spending function bounds use \code{\link[=gs_spending_bound]{gs_spending_bound()}}.
 
ARGUMENTS: par For \code{gs_b()}, this is just Z-values for the boundaries;
can include infinite values.
k Is \code{NULL} (default), return \code{par}, else return \code{par[k]}.
... Further arguments passed to or from other methods. 
EXAMPLE: 
# Simple: enter a vector of length 3 for bound
gs_b(par = 4:2)

# 2nd element of par
gs_b(par = 4:2, k = 2)

# Generate an efficacy bound using a spending function
# Use Lan-DeMets spending approximation of O&#39;Brien-Fleming bound
# as 50%, 75% and 100% of final spending
# Information fraction
IF &lt;- c(.5, .75, 1)

  alpha = .025, k = length(IF),
  test.type = 1, sfu = gsDesign::sfLDOF,
  timing = IF

FUNCTION: gs_design_npe 
TITLE: Group sequential design computation with non-constant effect and information 
DESCRIPTION: 
Derives group sequential design size,
bounds and boundary crossing probabilities based on proportionate
information and effect size at analyses.
It allows a non-constant treatment effect over time,
but also can be applied for the usual homogeneous effect size designs.
It requires treatment effect and proportionate statistical information
at each analysis as well as a method of deriving bounds, such as spending.
The routine enables two things not available in the gsDesign package:
\enumerate{
\item non-constant effect, 2) more flexibility in boundary selection.
For many applications, the non-proportional-hazards design function
\code{gs_design_nph()} will be used; it calls this function.
Initial bound types supported are 1) spending bounds,
\item fixed bounds, and 3) Haybittle-Peto-like bounds.
The requirement is to have a boundary update method that
can each bound without knowledge of future bounds.
As an example, bounds based on conditional power that
require knowledge of all future bounds are not supported by this routine;
a more limited conditional power method will be demonstrated.
Boundary family designs Wang-Tsiatis designs including
the original (non-spending-function-based) O&#39;Brien-Fleming and Pocock designs
are not supported by \code{\link[=gs_power_npe]{gs_power_npe()}}.
}
 
ARGUMENTS: theta Natural parameter for group sequential design
representing expected incremental drift at all analyses;
used for power calculation.
theta0 Natural parameter used for upper bound spending;
if \code{NULL}, this will be set to 0.
theta1 Natural parameter used for lower bound spending;
if \code{NULL}, this will be set to \code{theta}
which yields the usual beta-spending.
If set to 0, spending is 2-sided under null hypothesis.
info Proportionate statistical information at
all analyses for input \code{theta}.
info0 Proportionate statistical information
under null hypothesis, if different than alternative;
impacts null hypothesis bound calculation.
info1 Proportionate statistical information
under alternate hypothesis;
impacts null hypothesis bound calculation.
info_scale Information scale for calculation. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{&#34;h0_h1_info&#34;} (default): variance under both null and alternative hypotheses is used.
\item \code{&#34;h0_info&#34;}: variance under null hypothesis is used.
\item \code{&#34;h1_info&#34;}: variance under alternative hypothesis is used.
}
alpha One-sided Type I error.
beta Type II error.
upper Function to compute upper bound.
upar Parameters passed to the function provided in \code{upper}.
lower Function to compare lower bound.
lpar Parameters passed to the function provided in \code{lower}.
test_upper Indicator of which analyses should include
an upper (efficacy) bound; single value of \code{TRUE} (default) indicates
all analyses; otherwise, a logical vector of the same length as \code{info}
should indicate which analyses will have an efficacy bound.
test_lower Indicator of which analyses should include an lower bound;
single value of \code{TRUE} (default) indicates all analyses;
single value \code{FALSE} indicates no lower bound; otherwise,
a logical vector of the same length as \code{info} should indicate which
analyses will have a lower bound.
binding Indicator of whether futility bound is binding;
default of \code{FALSE} is recommended.
r Integer value controlling grid for numerical integration
as in Jennison and Turnbull (2000); default is 18, range is 1 to 80.
Larger values provide larger number of grid points and greater accuracy.
Normally \code{r} will not be changed by the user.

FUNCTION: gs_power_npe 
TITLE: Group sequential bound computation with non-constant effect 
DESCRIPTION: 
Derives group sequential bounds and boundary crossing probabilities for a design.
It allows a non-constant treatment effect over time,
but also can be applied for the usual homogeneous effect size designs.
It requires treatment effect and statistical information at each analysis
as well as a method of deriving bounds, such as spending.
The routine enables two things not available in the gsDesign package:
\enumerate{
\item non-constant effect, 2) more flexibility in boundary selection.
For many applications, the non-proportional-hazards design function
\code{gs_design_nph()} will be used; it calls this function.
Initial bound types supported are 1) spending bounds,
\item fixed bounds, and 3) Haybittle-Peto-like bounds.
The requirement is to have a boundary update method that can
each bound without knowledge of future bounds.
As an example, bounds based on conditional power that require
knowledge of all future bounds are not supported by this routine;
a more limited conditional power method will be demonstrated.
Boundary family designs Wang-Tsiatis designs including the
original (non-spending-function-based) O&#39;Brien-Fleming and Pocock designs
are not supported by \code{gs_power_npe()}.
}
 
ARGUMENTS: theta Natural parameter for group sequential design representing
expected incremental drift at all analyses; used for power calculation.
theta0 Natural parameter for null hypothesis,
if needed for upper bound computation.
theta1 Natural parameter for alternate hypothesis,
if needed for lower bound computation.
info Statistical information at all analyses for input \code{theta}.
info0 Statistical information under null hypothesis,
if different than \code{info};
impacts null hypothesis bound calculation.
info1 Statistical information under hypothesis used for
futility bound calculation if different from
\code{info}; impacts futility hypothesis bound calculation.
info_scale Information scale for calculation. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{&#34;h0_h1_info&#34;} (default): variance under both null and alternative hypotheses is used.
\item \code{&#34;h0_info&#34;}: variance under null hypothesis is used.
\item \code{&#34;h1_info&#34;}: variance under alternative hypothesis is used.
}
upper Function to compute upper bound.
upar Parameters passed to \code{upper}.
lower Function to compare lower bound.
lpar parameters passed to \code{lower}.
test_upper Indicator of which analyses should include
an upper (efficacy) bound;
single value of \code{TRUE} (default) indicates all analyses; otherwise,
a logical vector of the same length as \code{info} should
indicate which analyses will have an efficacy bound.
test_lower Indicator of which analyses should include a lower bound;
single value of \code{TRUE} (default) indicates all analyses;
single value of \code{FALSE} indicated no lower bound; otherwise,
a logical vector of the same length as \code{info} should
indicate which analyses will have a lower bound.
binding Indicator of whether futility bound is binding;
default of \code{FALSE} is recommended.
r Integer value controlling grid for numerical integration as in
Jennison and Turnbull (2000); default is 18, range is 1 to 80.
Larger values provide larger number of grid points and greater accuracy.
Normally, \code{r} will not be changed by the user.

FUNCTION: gs_spending_bound 
TITLE: Derive spending bound for group sequential boundary 
DESCRIPTION: 
Computes one bound at a time based on spending under given distributional
assumptions. While user specifies \code{gs_spending_bound()} for use with other
functions, it is not intended for use on its own.
Most important user specifications are made through a list provided to
functions using \code{gs_spending_bound()}.
Function uses numerical integration and Newton-Raphson iteration to derive
an individual bound for a group sequential design that satisfies a
targeted boundary crossing probability. Algorithm is a simple extension of
that in Chapter 19 of Jennison and Turnbull (2000).
 
ARGUMENTS: k Analysis for which bound is to be computed.
par A list with the following items:
\itemize{
\item \code{sf} (class spending function).
\item \code{total_spend} (total spend).
\item \code{param} (any parameters needed by the spending function \code{sf()}).
\item \code{timing} (a vector containing values at which spending function
is to be evaluated or \code{NULL} if information-based spending is used).
\item \code{max_info} (when \code{timing} is \code{NULL}, this can be input as positive number
to be used with \code{info} for information fraction at each analysis).
}
hgm1 Subdensity grid from \code{h1()} (k=2) or \code{hupdate()} (k&gt;2)
for analysis k-1; if k=1, this is not used and may be \code{NULL}.
theta Natural parameter used for lower bound only spending;
represents average drift at each time of analysis at least up to analysis k;
upper bound spending is always set under null hypothesis (theta = 0).
info Statistical information at all analyses, at least up to analysis k.
efficacy \code{TRUE} (default) for efficacy bound, \code{FALSE} otherwise.
test_bound A logical vector of the same length as \code{info}
should indicate which analyses will have a bound.
r Integer value controlling grid for numerical integration
as in Jennison and Turnbull (2000); default is 18, range is 1 to 80.
Larger values provide larger number of grid points and greater accuracy.
Normally \code{r} will not be changed by the user.
tol Tolerance parameter for convergence (on Z-scale).

gs_power_ahr(
  analysis_time = c(12, 24, 36),
  event = c(30, 40, 50),

ARGUMENTS: x A design created by either \code{\link[=gs_design_ahr]{gs_design_ahr()}} or \code{\link[=gs_power_ahr]{gs_power_ahr()}}.
alpha Type I error for the updated design.
ustime Default is NULL in which case upper bound spending time is determined by timing.
Otherwise, this should be a vector of length k (total number of analyses)
with the spending time at each analysis.
lstime Default is NULL in which case lower bound spending time is determined by timing.
Otherwise, this should be a vector of length k (total number of analyses)
with the spending time at each analysis.
event_tbl A data frame with two columns: (1) analysis and (2) event,
which represents the events observed at each analysis per piecewise interval.
This can be defined via the \code{pw_observed_event()} function or manually entered.
For example, consider a scenario with two intervals in the piecewise model:
the first interval lasts 6 months with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1,
and the second interval follows with an HR of 0.6.
The data frame \code{event_tbl = data.frame(analysis = c(1, 1, 2, 2), event = c(30, 100, 30, 200))}
indicates that 30 events were observed during the delayed effect period,
130 events were observed at the IA, and 230 events were observed at the FA.

FUNCTION: gsDesign2-package 
TITLE: gsDesign2: Group Sequential Design with Non-Constant Effect 
DESCRIPTION: 
\if{html\figure{logo.pngoptions: style=&#39;float: right&#39; alt=&#39;logo&#39; width=&#39;120&#39;}}

The goal of &#39;gsDesign2&#39; is to enable fixed or group sequential design under non-proportional hazards. To enable highly flexible enrollment, time-to-event and time-to-dropout assumptions, &#39;gsDesign2&#39; offers piecewise constant enrollment, failure rates, and dropout rates for a stratified population. This package includes three methods for designs: average hazard ratio, weighted logrank tests in Yung and Liu (2019) c(&#34;\\Sexpr[results=rd]{tools:::Rd_expr_doi(\&#34;#1\&#34;)}&#34;, &#34;10.1111/biom.13196&#34;)\Sexpr{tools:::Rd_expr_doi(&#34;10.1111/biom.13196&#34;)}, and MaxCombo tests. Substantial flexibility on top of what is in the &#39;gsDesign&#39; package is intended for selecting boundaries.

FUNCTION: to_integer 
TITLE: Round sample size and events 
DESCRIPTION: 
Round sample size and events
 
ARGUMENTS: x An object returned by fixed_design_xxx() and gs_design_xxx().
... Additional parameters (not used).
round_up_final Events at final analysis is rounded up if \code{TRUE};
otherwise, just rounded, unless it is very close to an integer.
ratio Positive integer for randomization ratio (experimental:control).
A positive integer will result in rounded sample size, which is a multiple of (ratio &#43; 1).
A positive non-integer will result in round sample size, which may not be a multiple of (ratio &#43; 1).
A negative number will result in an error.
