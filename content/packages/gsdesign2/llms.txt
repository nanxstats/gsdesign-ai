# gsDesign2 R Package Documentation

## Overview

gsDesign2 is the next generation group sequential design package with modern R implementation and enhanced capabilities for complex trial designs.

## Key Functions

- gs_design_ahr(): Design for average hazard ratio
- gs_design_nph(): Design for non-proportional hazards
- gs_power_ahr(): Power calculations for average hazard ratio
- define_enroll_rate(): Define enrollment rates
- define_fail_rate(): Define failure rates
- gs_design_combo(): Multiple endpoint designs

## Example Usage

library(gsDesign2)
design <- gs_design_ahr(
  enroll_rate = define_enroll_rate(duration = 18, rate = 1),
  fail_rate = define_fail_rate(duration = c(4, 100), fail_rate = log(2) / 12, hr = c(1, 0.7)),
  alpha = 0.025,
  beta = 0.1
)
