# simtrial R Package Documentation

## Overview

simtrial provides comprehensive simulation capabilities for clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints, enabling validation of trial designs and assessment of operating characteristics.

## Key Functions

- sim_pw_surv(): Simulate piecewise survival data
- sim_gs_n(): Simulate group sequential trials
- sim_fixed_n(): Simulate fixed sample size trials
- define_enroll_rate(): Define enrollment patterns
- define_fail_rate(): Define failure and dropout rates
- operating_characteristics(): Calculate trial performance metrics

## Example Usage

library(simtrial)
enroll_rate <- define_enroll_rate(duration = 18, rate = 20)
fail_rate <- define_fail_rate(duration = c(4, 100), fail_rate = log(2) / 12, hr = c(1, 0.7))
sim_results <- sim_pw_surv(n_sim = 1000, study_duration = 36, enroll_rate = enroll_rate, fail_rate = fail_rate)
