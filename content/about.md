## Making clinical trial design accessible to AI

gsDesign.ai provides specialized documentation for R packages related to group sequential design, optimized for consumption by AI code editors and assistants. Our goal is to bridge the gap between complex statistical methods and modern AI-powered development tools.

## Why gsDesign.ai?

### The challenge

Traditional documentation, while comprehensive, is not always structured in a way that AI coding assistants can easily parse and understand. This can lead to:

- Incomplete or inaccurate code suggestions.
- Missed best practices.
- Inefficient implementation of statistical methods.

### Our solution

We provide:

1. **Regular updates**: The documentation is synchronized with package updates.
1. **AI-optimized format**: Documentation is structured with clear hierarchies, examples, and metadata.
1. **Context preservation**: Maintains relationships between functions and concepts.
1. **Integration ready**: Works seamlessly with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI coding tools.

## Featured packages

Our documentation covers essential packages for group sequential design:

- **gsDesign**: The original comprehensive package for group sequential design
- **gsDesign2**: Group sequential design with non-constant effect
- **simtrial**: Clinical trial simulation
