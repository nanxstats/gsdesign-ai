## Making Clinical Trial Design Accessible to AI

gsDesign.ai provides specialized documentation for R packages related to group sequential design, optimized for consumption by AI code editors and assistants. Our goal is to bridge the gap between complex statistical methods and modern AI-powered development tools.

## Why gsDesign.ai?

### The Challenge

Traditional documentation, while comprehensive, isn't always structured in a way that AI assistants can easily parse and understand. This can lead to:

- Incomplete or inaccurate code suggestions
- Missed best practices
- Inefficient implementation of statistical methods

### Our Solution

We provide:

- **Structured Documentation**: Formatted specifically for AI consumption
- **Context-Rich Examples**: Real-world use cases that AI can learn from
- **Best Practices**: Embedded guidance for proper implementation
- **Version Tracking**: Always up-to-date with the latest package releases

## Featured Packages

Our documentation covers essential packages for group sequential design:

- **gsDesign**: The original comprehensive package for group sequential design
- **gsDesign2**: Group sequential design with non-constant effect
- **simtrial**: Clinical trial simulation

## How It Works

1. **AI-Optimized Format**: Documentation is structured with clear hierarchies, examples, and metadata
2. **Regular Updates**: Automated synchronization with package updates
3. **Context Preservation**: Maintains relationships between functions and concepts
4. **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other AI tools
